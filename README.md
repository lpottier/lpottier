Hi, Iâ€™m a computer scientist at @LLNL for CASC. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of parallel computing and resource management:
- Scheduling problems in HPC and distributed computing
- Resilience & reliability at Exascale
- Scientific workflows management
- Distributed Machine Learning on HPC systems
