Hi, Iâ€™m a computer scientist at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of parallel computing and resource management:
- Scheduling problems in HPC and distributed computing
- Resilience & reliability at Exascale
- Scientific workflows management
- Distributed Machine Learning on HPC systems

You can find my recent publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hL9eZlQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) profile!
